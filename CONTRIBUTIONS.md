## How to contribute to OpenDig

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead refer to our [security policy]().

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/OpenDig/opendig-web/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/OpenDig/opendig-web/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**:
  * [NEED BUG TEMPLATES]()

* For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [reporting guidelines]().

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to OpenDig]() guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

---

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [OpenDig Discussions forum](https://github.com/OpenDig/opendig-web/discussions/categories/ideas) and start writing code.
